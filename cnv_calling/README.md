In this project I identify breakpoints for deletions and duplications for individuals coming from different ethnicities by cnv calling. 

There are 50 control probes that function well. We use them to estimate expected read depths 
for each individual by fitting a line through the origin. Then we use these estimations for cnv calling on the test probes. Using 
these I identify breakpoints for deletions and duplications.
